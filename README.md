# Andrew-Ryu-Updated-Portfolio

## Task

In this homework I've applied the core skills I learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

## Acceptance Criteria

Critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
WHEN I load my portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them  ✅

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section  ✅

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications  ✅

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others  ✅

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application  ✅

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport  ✅
```
